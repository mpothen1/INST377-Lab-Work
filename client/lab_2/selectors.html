            <p>CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.
                Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages. 
                Once you successfully develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, it's relativley easy to match a document to those rules
